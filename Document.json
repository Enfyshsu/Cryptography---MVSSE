        "content": "SDN technology is currently available for industrial control applications that require extremely fast failover, called Operational Technology (OT) Software Defined Networking (SDN).  OT SDN technology is an approach to manage network access control and Ethernet packet delivery on environmentally hardened hardware for critical infrastructure networks. OT SDN abstracts the management of the control plane from the switches centralizing it in the flow controller and applies SDN as the underlay control plane in the switch. The legacy control plane is removed simplifying the switch while centralizing the control plane management. The common control plane standard used in OT SDN is OpenFlow making it interoperable with other SDN solutions with the difference being that OpenFlow is the only control plane in the switch and that the switch retains flows through power cycles and all flows and redundancy are proactively traffic engineered so the switches can perform the forwarding they are configured to perform with or without the flow controller online. OT SDN provides advantages for industrial networks in the form of performance, cybersecurity and situational awareness. Performance advantages are achieved through proactively traffic engineering contingencies using Fast Failover groups in OpenFlow resulting in network healing from link or switch failures in microseconds not milliseconds like spanning tree technology.  Another performance advantage is that loop mitigation is done through traffic engineered path planning and not blocked ports allowing the system owner to actively use all ports. Cybersecurity advantages of OT SDN is that the switches are deny by default and flows are the rules that allow traffic to be forwarded. This provides strong network access control where packets can be inspected from layer 1 through layer 4 of the OSI model at each hop. Legacy control plane security vulnerabilities are removed since the legacy control plane no longer exists. MAC table spoofing and BPDU spoofing are no longer possible because neither exist in the OT SDN switches. Pivoting and network reconnaissance no longer work with proper flow programming as only allowed traffic is approved to be forwarded combining the physical location and path with the virtual packet filtering. Situational awareness advantages of OT SDN provide the network owner with the visibility to what devices are on their network and what conversations can and are happening and who those conversations can happen between.  OT SDN network technology allows Ethernet networks to meet the demanding communication message exchange requirements of measurement and control for critical infrastructure and simply provides the system owner control over what devices can connect to the network, where those devices can connect, and what conversations each device can have.",

One of these used a circular firing platform and this was adopted for the new guns. The firing platform was attached to the gun and when lowered the gun was pulled onto it. This platform transferred most of the recoil forces to the ground, instead of using the spade at the end of the trail, making the gun very stable when firing. It also provided a smooth flat surface for the carriage to rotate on using the road wheels, this enabled the gunners to traverse the carriage quickly in any direction.",

OT SDN technology is an approach to manage network access control and Ethernet packet delivery on environmentally hardened hardware for critical infrastructure networks. OT SDN abstracts the management of the control plane from the switches centralizing it in the flow controller and applies SDN as the underlay control plane in the switch. The legacy control plane is removed simplifying the switch while centralizing the control plane management. The common control plane standard used in OT SDN is OpenFlow making it interoperable with other SDN solutions with the difference being that OpenFlow is the only control plane in the switch and that the switch retains flows through power cycles and all flows and redundancy are proactively traffic engineered so the switches can perform the forwarding they are configured to perform with or without the flow controller online. OT SDN provides advantages for industrial networks in the form of performance, cybersecurity and situational awareness. Performance advantages are achieved through proactively traffic engineering contingencies using Fast Failover groups in OpenFlow resulting in network healing from link or switch failures in microseconds not milliseconds like spanning tree technology.  Another performance advantage is that loop mitigation is done through traffic engineered path planning and not blocked ports allowing the system owner to actively use all ports. Cybersecurity advantages of OT SDN is that the switches are deny by default and flows are the rules that allow traffic to be forwarded. This provides strong network access control where packets can be inspected from layer 1 through layer 4 of the OSI model at each hop. Legacy control plane security vulnerabilities are removed since the legacy control plane no longer exists. MAC table spoofing and BPDU spoofing are no longer possible because neither exist in the OT SDN switches. Pivoting and network reconnaissance no longer work with proper flow programming as only allowed traffic is approved to be forwarded combining the physical location and path with the virtual packet filtering. Situational awareness advantages of OT SDN provide the network owner with the visibility to what devices are on their network and what conversations can and are happening and who those conversations can happen between.  OT SDN network technology allows Ethernet networks to meet the demanding communication message exchange requirements of measurement and control for critical infrastructure and simply provides the system owner control over what devices can connect to the network, where those devices can connect, and what conversations each device can have.",

This resemblance was by design so that security could be retrofitted into existing socket programs with only minor modifications. Also, with such a sublayer carefully designed and its implementation thoroughly debugged, it can be easily used by any Internet application that uses sockets for end-to-end communications. This is a natural idea in hindsight but, in 1993, it was novel and a major departure from mainstream network security research at that time.",

If the element has a length-to-diameter ratio of 1000, it will have an inherent impedance of about 63\u00a0ohms resistive. Using the appropriate transmission wire or balun, we match that resistance to ensure minimum signal reflection. Feeding that antenna with a current of 1\u00a0Ampere will require 63\u00a0Volts, and the antenna will radiate 63\u00a0Watts (ignoring losses) of radio frequency power. Now consider the case when the antenna is fed a signal with a wavelength of 1.25\u00a0m; in this case the current induced by the signal would arrive at the antenna's feedpoint out-of-phase with the signal, causing the net current to drop while the voltage remains the same. Electrically this appears to be a very high impedance. The antenna and transmission line no longer have the same impedance, and the signal will be reflected back into the antenna, reducing output. This could be addressed by changing the matching system between the antenna and transmission line, but that solution only works well at the new design frequency.",
