        "content": "SDN technology is currently available for industrial control applications that require extremely fast failover, called Operational Technology (OT) Software Defined Networking (SDN).  OT SDN technology is an approach to manage network access control and Ethernet packet delivery on environmentally hardened hardware for critical infrastructure networks. OT SDN abstracts the management of the control plane from the switches centralizing it in the flow controller and applies SDN as the underlay control plane in the switch. The legacy control plane is removed simplifying the switch while centralizing the control plane management. The common control plane standard used in OT SDN is OpenFlow making it interoperable with other SDN solutions with the difference being that OpenFlow is the only control plane in the switch and that the switch retains flows through power cycles and all flows and redundancy are proactively traffic engineered so the switches can perform the forwarding they are configured to perform with or without the flow controller online. OT SDN provides advantages for industrial networks in the form of performance, cybersecurity and situational awareness. Performance advantages are achieved through proactively traffic engineering contingencies using Fast Failover groups in OpenFlow resulting in network healing from link or switch failures in microseconds not milliseconds like spanning tree technology.  Another performance advantage is that loop mitigation is done through traffic engineered path planning and not blocked ports allowing the system owner to actively use all ports. Cybersecurity advantages of OT SDN is that the switches are deny by default and flows are the rules that allow traffic to be forwarded. This provides strong network access control where packets can be inspected from layer 1 through layer 4 of the OSI model at each hop. Legacy control plane security vulnerabilities are removed since the legacy control plane no longer exists. MAC table spoofing and BPDU spoofing are no longer possible because neither exist in the OT SDN switches. Pivoting and network reconnaissance no longer work with proper flow programming as only allowed traffic is approved to be forwarded combining the physical location and path with the virtual packet filtering. Situational awareness advantages of OT SDN provide the network owner with the visibility to what devices are on their network and what conversations can and are happening and who those conversations can happen between.  OT SDN network technology allows Ethernet networks to meet the demanding communication message exchange requirements of measurement and control for critical infrastructure and simply provides the system owner control over what devices can connect to the network, where those devices can connect, and what conversations each device can have.",

Full-duplex mode has only one transmitter and one receiver per collision domain, making collisions impossible.",

Using the appropriate transmission wire or balun, we match that resistance to ensure minimum signal reflection. Feeding that antenna with a current of 1\u00a0Ampere will require 63\u00a0Volts, and the antenna will radiate 63\u00a0Watts (ignoring losses) of radio frequency power. Now consider the case when the antenna is fed a signal with a wavelength of 1.25\u00a0m; in this case the current induced by the signal would arrive at the antenna's feedpoint out-of-phase with the signal, causing the net current to drop while the voltage remains the same. Electrically this appears to be a very high impedance. The antenna and transmission line no longer have the same impedance, and the signal will be reflected back into the antenna, reducing output.

OT SDN technology is an approach to manage network access control and Ethernet packet delivery on environmentally hardened hardware for critical infrastructure networks. OT SDN abstracts the management of the control plane from the switches centralizing it in the flow controller and applies SDN as the underlay control plane in the switch. The legacy control plane is removed simplifying the switch while centralizing the control plane management. The common control plane standard used in OT SDN is OpenFlow making it interoperable with other SDN solutions with the difference being that OpenFlow is the only control plane in the switch and that the switch retains flows through power cycles and all flows and redundancy are proactively traffic engineered so the switches can perform the forwarding they are configured to perform with or without the flow controller online. OT SDN provides advantages for industrial networks in the form of performance, cybersecurity and situational awareness. Performance advantages are achieved through proactively traffic engineering contingencies using Fast Failover groups in OpenFlow resulting in network healing from link or switch failures in microseconds not milliseconds like spanning tree technology.  Another performance advantage is that loop mitigation is done through traffic engineered path planning and not blocked ports allowing the system owner to actively use all ports. Cybersecurity advantages of OT SDN is that the switches are deny by default and flows are the rules that allow traffic to be forwarded. This provides strong network access control where packets can be inspected from layer 1 through layer 4 of the OSI model at each hop. Legacy control plane security vulnerabilities are removed since the legacy control plane no longer exists. MAC table spoofing and BPDU spoofing are no longer possible because neither exist in the OT SDN switches. Pivoting and network reconnaissance no longer work with proper flow programming as only allowed traffic is approved to be forwarded combining the physical location and path with the virtual packet filtering. Situational awareness advantages of OT SDN provide the network owner with the visibility to what devices are on their network and what conversations can and are happening and who those conversations can happen between.  OT SDN network technology allows Ethernet networks to meet the demanding communication message exchange requirements of measurement and control for critical infrastructure and simply provides the system owner control over what devices can connect to the network, where those devices can connect, and what conversations each device can have.",

With solid state radios becoming more common in the 1970s, the FCC revised this specification at the same time the authorized channels were increased to 40. The current specification is simply \"4\u00a0watts output (AM) or 12\u00a0watts output (SSB)\" as measured at the antenna connector on the back of the radio. The old specification was often used in false advertising by some manufacturers who would claim their CB radios had \"5\u00a0watts\" long after the specification had changed to 4\u00a0watts output. The older 23\u00a0channel radios built under the old specifications typically had an output of around 3.5 to 3.8\u00a0watts output when measured at the antenna connector. The FCC simply rounded up the old \"5\u00a0watts DC input to the final amplifier stage\" specification to the new \"4\u00a0watts output as measured at the antenna connector on the back of the radio\", resulting in a far simpler and easier specification.",
